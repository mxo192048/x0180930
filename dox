Favorite Quotes	"In a world full of people who couldn't care less, be someone who couldn't care more..." "You see I don't... I don't work within any exact boundaries of the law because I wasn't consulted when the god damn laws were made. No, instead nameless, faceless politicians, the so called "protectors" of the moral majority decide what is right and what is wrong. I mean come on! I govern my life around my own personal code of ethics, and I suggest that you do the same. That way if, within the constructs of my own morality, I were to do something that is considered illegal, so be it. I feel no guilt whatsoever and furthermore, if I were to buckle under the social weight of the system by adhering to laws that I do not truly believe in then I would be extinguishing the very fire of patriotism and individuality."
About You	I am pretty close to being a genius....however there's a fine line between being brilliant and crazy.
